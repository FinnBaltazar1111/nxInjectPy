# nxInjectPy
Useful tool to inject a Nintendo Switch payload in Python, without specifying the payload's location.

# Usage
**Building is not required**. Just clone this repository and run `main.py`, or to continuously run (useful for dongles, which can auto-inject preset payloads), use `repeat.sh`. Default payload is [hekate v6.2.0](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases/tag/v6.2.0). If you prefer a different payload, replace `payload.bin` with your payload, and, of course, **make sure it's named `payload.bin`**.
